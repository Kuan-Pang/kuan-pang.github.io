I am a first-year Ph.D. student in ![](/assets/img/logo/stanford_logo.png){: width="16" } [Stanford](https://www.stanford.edu/) Computer Science, advised by Prof. [Jure Leskovec](https://snap.stanford.edu/index.html).

My research interests focus on AI4Biomedicine, particularly in developing spatial-temporal models for predictive biology, machine learning-guided experiment design, and self-driving labs.

Previously, I did my B.S. in {Computer Science, Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, and Statistics} @ ![](/assets/img/logo/Utoronto_coa.svg.png){: width="16" } [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) and had the fortune to work at ![](/assets/img/logo/vector_logo.png){: width="16" } [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/) with Prof. [Bo Wang](https://wanglab.ai/index.html).
